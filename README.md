## Contribution

These docs are intended to be public, and contributions are always welcome. Please raise a PR and we'll approve regularly!

### Contribution License Agreement

The first time you submit a pull request (PR) to a Reddit project, [you should complete our CLA](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScG6Bf3yqS05yWV0pbh5Q60AsaXP2mw35_i7ZA19_7jWNJKsg/viewform). We cannot accept PRs from GitHub users that have not agreed to the CLA. Note that this agreement applies to all open source Reddit projects, and you only need to submit it once.

## Make sure to update both versioned and unversioned docs

All changes made to the Devvit docs but be made to both the latest [versioned instance](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-docs/tree/main/versioned_docs) of the docs as well as the [unversioned instance](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-docs/tree/main/docs) of those docs. While we know this isn't ideal, it is essential for ensuring changes aren't overwritten as new versions of Devvit are released.

## Development

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
