# Media Uploads

:::warning
Apps can only display images hosted on Reddit
:::

You can upload images to Reddit at runtime using the `media` capability. This is different than static images, which are part of your [assets](../blocks/app_image_assets.md).

Runtime images are useful for embedding images in RTJSON (Posts and Comments) as well as displaying them within an interactive post app.

## Enabling media uploads
Enable the `media` permission in your `devvit.json` file.
```json title="devvit.json"
{
  "permissions": {
    "media": true
  }
}
```

## Using media uploads
On the server, you can pass the URL of any remotely hosted image (even if its not hosted on Reddit) to the `media.upload` function. This function will return a Reddit URL. Both HTTP and data URLs are supported.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="web" label="Devvit Web">
  ```ts title="server/index.ts"
  import { media } from '@devvit/media';
  function submitImage() {
    const response = await media.upload({
      url: 'https://media2.giphy.com/media/xTiN0CNHgoRf1Ha7CM/giphy.gif',
      type: 'gif',
    });
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="blocks" label="Devvit Blocks / Mod Tools">
  ```ts
  import { Devvit } from '@devvit/public-api';

  const response = await media.upload({
    url: 'https://media2.giphy.com/media/xTiN0CNHgoRf1Ha7CM/giphy.gif',
    type: 'gif',
  });
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Limitations

The following file types are supported, along with a corresponding maximum size limit:
- JPEG, PNG, and WEBP: up to 20 MB
- GIF: up to 100 MB

### Notes

- When uploading through a data URL, the size limit is 7.5 MB regardless of file type due to request size limits.
- When uploading a WEBP image, it will be converted to JPEG. As such, the Reddit URL returned points to a JPEG image.
