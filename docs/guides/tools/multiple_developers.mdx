title: Multiple Developers
---

Multiple developers working on a single app can clash with each other's uploads during playtesting. This is due to the same playtest subreddit and app name being used.

Local environment variables allow multiple developers to share a single codebase while each having separate playtest subreddits and app names.

## Setup

- Keep `devvit.json` in git
- Use local environment variables per developer to override the local targets used by the Devvit CLI:
  - `DEVVIT_SUBREDDIT` (where you playtest)
  - `DEVVIT_APP_NAME` (the app name the CLI uses)
- Alternatively, use a local `.env` file and ensure it's not committed by adding it to `.gitignore`

This gives each developer an isolated development lane without forking the repository or repeatedly editing `devvit.json`.

:::warning
Local environment variables and `.env` files are read during playtesting only. For API keys and other sensitive values, use [Settings and Secrets](/capabilities/server/settings-and-secrets).

## Why not remove `devvit.json` from git?

`devvit.json` is part of the app's core configuration, including capabilities, entry points, and permissions. If it isn't versioned, teammates can drift out-of-sync due to mismatched configurations. Instead, keep `devvit.json` stable and use local environment overrides.
