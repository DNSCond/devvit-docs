# GameMaker Quickstart

This page walks you through building a GameMaker app for Devvit. Once complete, you'll see your GameMaker game running directly within a Reddit post.

If you are already familiar with Devvit and want to jump straight to exporting, see the  [Build and Deploy GameMaker Games to Devvit ](#build-and-deploy-gamemaker-games-to-devvit) section.

## Try it out

The template creates a simple GameMaker game and demonstrates data exchange between Reddit and GameMaker.

<img src={require('../assets/quickstart_gamemaker.gif').default} alt="GameMaker example" style={{maxWidth: '40%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto'}} />

## What you'll need

- Node.js (version 22.2.0+)
- [GameMaker 2024.1400.3](https://releases.gamemaker.io/release-notes/2024/1400_3) or later (this version adds direct exporting to Reddit)

## Environment setup

1. Install Node.js and npm ([instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm))
2. Go to [developers.reddit.com/new](https://developers.reddit.com/new) and select the GameMaker template
3. Complete the setup wizard (you'll need to create a Reddit account and connect it to Reddit Developers)
4. Follow the instructions in your terminal

On success, you should see something like this:

```sh
Your Devvit authentication token has been saved to /Users/user.name/.devvit/token

 🚀🚀🚀 Devvit app successfully initialized!

│ • `cd my-app` to open your project directory       │
│ • `npm run dev` to develop in your test community  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Running your app

To run your app, navigate to your project directory with `cd my-app` and run `npm run dev`. You should see logs that conclude with:

```
https://www.reddit.com/r/my-app_dev?playtest=my-app
```

Follow this link to see your app.

## Build and Deploy GameMaker Games to Devvit

For step-by-step export instructions, see the [GameMaker Reddit Template documentation](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMakerRedditTemplate/blob/main/docs/HowToBuild.md).

## Communicate between GameMaker and Reddit

GameMaker games communicate with Reddit through HTTP requests. The provided template includes working examples of this data exchange:

- **GameMaker client code**: [reddit_demo_server_api.gml](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GM-RedditDemo/blob/main/source/Reddit_gml/scripts/reddit_demo_server_api/reddit_demo_server_api.gml) — Shows how to send requests from GameMaker to retrieve user data, save scores, and interact with Reddit features.
- **Devvit server code**: [src/server/index.ts](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-template-gamemaker/blob/main/src/server/index.ts) — Handles incoming requests from GameMaker, accesses Reddit APIs, and stores data in Redis.
